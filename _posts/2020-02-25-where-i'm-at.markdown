 Hi! Welcome to the first post of my blog!

 I've been listening to coding podcasts and chatting to some of my partner's pals (he's a back-end software engineer), and based on their anecdotes it seems that mine is a pretty common story. I've been working in some field or other, I've come across coding, and after a certain amount of time playing with programming languages something clicked and my interest jumped from a passive curiosity to an active desire to achieve competency and make this my primary career.

I'm a chemist. Aside from a few bar jobs chemistry is the only field I've worked in. Aspects of it appeal to me; I enjoy analysis and troubleshooting, I enjoy designing studies and products, I enjoy compiling data and producing reports. I derive satisfaction from these things. 

Other aspects of industrial chemistry are less attractive, such as the long-term health effects of daily chemical exposure.

Until recently I considered my current occupation more attractive than most viable alternatives. Now I'm not so sure. Thing is, computers are cool as heck. They allow for so much fun and useful stuff. Code is fundamentally a construction tool that allows you to make devices way beyond what a single individual could make in the physical world, and with minimal resources. It inherently allows sharing of creations to facilitate cooperative development. It's nifty, it's fun and it's a great way to play with others!

What's more, computational technology is still in its infancy and the people who work on it right now are building the foundations of a whole new human technology, one that rivals writing and mathematics in terms of its capacity to fundamentally change how our society operates. Who wouldn't want to be a part of that?

Conversation with friends, listening to podcasts and reading blogs has made it clear to me that I could do well as a developer. I mentioned that my partner recently switched career from teacher to back-end developer. It took him about a year and a half to go from a coding newbie to a professional software engineer. Another friend got into the industry purely through self-tuition. I know I can do the same.  I have the basic traits I need. I just need to work hard and learn to, like, actually code.

This is the start of my coding journey. I'm going to work hard, and Ima do it!
